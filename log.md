# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 16: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy day. Worked on Javascript random number challenge, Lodash Javascript Library and Map, Filter and Reduce.  Worked on Python exercises re: Modules, Classes and Objects with PythonFor All study group.  Read about Flask project architecture. Added initial CSS variables and links to the Flask Portfolio Website Project. [Explore Flask](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/preface.html)

**Thoughts:**  I spent a fair amount of time on the projects but not sure I truly made significant progress in each.  I did learn some new concepts and move forward in each discipline so in that perspective Day 16 was a success.  I definitely felt a little disconcerted at times and of course, wonder if I could have accomplished more working in depth in one or two things rather than covering so much ground in one day.

## Day 15: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: It has been Javascript all day today.  Read about Flask project structures which was also great [Explore Flask](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/preface.html)

**Thoughts:**  Worked on solving a Javascript problem - weighted lottery function. No commits because I have not found the solution yet. I know what needs to happen but I keep runnning into challenges with manipulating the different data structures to give the result.  It seems like it should be easy but then the challenges arise.  I did solve this exact same problem in Python with no issues at all.

**Link(s) to work:**  No commits today.

## Day 14: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work on Javascript Promises, Callbacks and Async Await. 

**Thoughts:**  Worked on learning Javascript more Promises and asynchronous Functional programming.  It is finally starting to sink in - fetch API, callbacks, vs promise vs async await. Flask app also got more html template coding. Started learning JQuery but no commits yet.

### Day 13: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added additional html templates and App Routes for the Portfolio Website Flask App!! Worked on Javascript Promises, Group Promises and Callbacks. 

**Thoughts:**  Worked on learning Javascript more Promises and Functional programming.  In addition read entire Javascript Beginners Handbook which was a great review of everything I learned thus far.  The Portfolio Website Flask App continues to move along nicely. I changed the blog page design and I am much happier with it now. I realized that I needed to add more app routes for the details page of the blog posts and projects. 

I wonder if the project is too big and if there will be effects on loading and performance. This was always a consideration with Android Mobile Development - I have no idea how it translates to the web.  Now it is time to get into the nuts and bolts of how the blog posts and projects will be arranged and loaded onto the templates.  This will be the challenging part of the project I think...well besides the CSS of course, lol. Then I have to think about hosting and deployment. Well...one step at a time.

### Day 12: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed App Routes for the Portfolio Website Flask App!! Worked on Javascript Promises. 

**Thoughts:**  ***I am having way too much fun coding this Flask App!!!!***  It is without a doubt the highlight of my coding experience.  Since I have an extra organized build process now, it makes it super easy and enjoyable.  My process:  I created the file structure first. Downloaded all of the python modules.  Coded most of the html templates. Today I built the skeleton of the flask app with all the routes to the templates. Created a project to-do Kanban board [My Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/thisdevlovestech/projects/1) so that I know exactly what needs to be done. The best part - I can quickly test each segment to ensure it works. This is much better than last time when I coded so much then took 3 days debugging, smh.  Since the build process is so smooth and organized it gives me time to review the documentation. I hope every project I complete is this awesome.  More Javascript exercises as well - Functional Programming and Promises

### Day 11: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. 

**Thoughts:** Javascript Exercises. More Object Oriented programming. I am motivated to get back into the Flask app.  It will happen.

### Day 10: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. Still coding the Flask app foundation 

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much coding done today as I would have preferred.  I wish I could spend more time coding and less time doing other stuff. Worked on Javascript classes, object oriented programing today.

### Day 9: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python exercises. Started coding the Flask app foundation 

**Thoughts:** Trying to keep the rules solid in my mind, switching back and forth with Python and Javascript.  Theres no doubt I prefer Python. Today I worked on Python Dictionaries and Lists and reviewed Lambda functions and zip function with PythonForAll study group. I'm building the Flask app foundation of the Portfolio Website Flask App. ****Someone please explain why is this so much fun?***  I will end up building everything on Flask at the rate I am going.

### Day 8: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. Started the Portfolio Website

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript Exercises, including arrow functions and classes. Started coding the Portfolio Website Flask App **** YES!!!!!!!!!!!***

### Day 7: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. CSS on To-Do Flask App. Started planning Portfolio Website Flask App

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript Exercises, including spread, bind function, determining object equivalence.  Also tweaked the CSS for the To-Do Flask App.  Started planning the Portfolio Website Flask App ***super excited about this***

### Day 6: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed FLASK APP YAY!!! Worked on Javascript exercises.

**Thoughts:** Found the bugs, big thanks to Stack Overflow and Flask Documentation !!!(***applause***). I currently have a working Flask App with Mongo DB Database and HTML/CSSS user interface. The bugs were so tiny and insignificant and yet they screwed up the whole project.  The first bug was a space between a bracket and modulus in one of the conditionals of the Flask app on the html template file.  The second was the absence of a period before the namespace in the template file. Today I also worked on Javascript Exercises, including more arrow functions, destructuring, object deconstruction, and spread function.

**Caught Bugs Below**

**Two Errors Preventing Jinja2 Engine From Pulling Data into the templates**

#1:
url_for('.index') – Missing the dot before the name             (Flask Documentation)


#2:
Typo, in the second for-loop – extra space before the %         (Stack Overflow) 
{   % for post in posts %}

The Reason: Since there is space after { before % Jinja will not recognize it as an endfor tag. thus giving you the error.



### Day 5: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript Exercises and debugging Flask App

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript Exercises, including arrow functions, destructuring and object deconstruction. Printed out error logs for Flask app, there were 17 errors listed, one that included Jinja2. Started going through each one - googling and checking code.  Hopefully this process works!

### Day 4: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, Mongo DB and Javascript Practice 

**Thoughts:** Haven't figured it out yet, why the data is not being pulled into the HTML templates. Now going through the code with a fine tooth comb.  I should have known that trying to figure out issues at this point would be a nightmare. I needed to test it sooner instead of building so much and trying to figure it out later.  That was never going to work, of course. I will give a few more days then scrap it and start from scratch and debug properly.

### Day 3: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, Mongo DB and more Javascript review

**Thoughts:** Worked on the HTML part of the Flask app.  For some reason the Jinja2 engine is not pulling data into the HTML templates although the Flask app is running. I have to troubleshoot that. On another note, I realize how rare it is for me to use table in my html documents.  I read somewhere that prior to modern css - flexbox and grid - developers would use TABLE to layout and position elements. Yikes!  As much as I have been tortured by flexbox and css-grid I would not have made it typing out all those tr's and td's!!

### Day 2: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, a small Javascript review, and some Python exercises

**Thoughts:** The HTML part of the Flask app continues to go well. I'm excited to see it all coming together.  I reviewed Python exercises and briefly saw some of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.  I definitely like Python 3 better so far. Just working on Javascript after spending a few weeks on Python I was forgetting all of the semicolons and yet things were still running...

### Day 1: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML and also a small Javascript challenge

**Thoughts:** The HTML part of the flask app went really well. I practiced using the Emmet abbreviations in VS Code, made everything super snappy.  The Javascript challenge was also fun.  I was able to see that it took me six lines of code to solve a simple challenge and the solution only needed one line of code plus a one line error built in.  Well at least I came up with a solution that worked. Student - 0 Instructor - 1  I realize I need to spend time understanding arrow functions in Javascript

### Day 0: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App with MongoDB, HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** It was super fun. Opening the python virtual environment, installing all the python modules, creating the Flask app with the routes for Mongo DB, which I just binge learned the week before (watching every video tutorial imaginable). Plus I spent 4 days pulling my hair out, and my computer literally threatened to report me, while trying to get MongoDB to actually run on the non-admin account on my computer.
