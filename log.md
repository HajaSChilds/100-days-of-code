# Day 71: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Designing and adding SCSS to a private React Repository 

**Thoughts:** Added node-sass to the npm packages.  Converted all css files to scss files.  Created a style folder and placed all scss files withing.  Created a main.scss folder and imported all scss files.  Added the main.scss file as an import to the index.js file.  This worked perfectly and all of the styles remained in place.  Also started checking out a responsive form javascript repo.


# Day 70: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on designing a website prototype using Moqups and Figma.

**Thoughts:** No code. 



# Day 69: June 28, 2020

# Day 68: June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on building a virtual assistant in Python.  Did not commit not working code

**Thoughts:** Some issues with the package module imports so the code did not run.  Will revisit.  

**Link(s) to work:**  [Python Virtual Assistant](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/virtual-assistant)



# Day 67: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on building a React Navigation Dropdown Menu in a Private React Repo

**Thoughts:** Used components to build a Navigation Dropdown Menu and Hamburger Menu. It was easier to create additional components and navigate using state than to use the change in Flex direction and media queries. 

**Link(s) to work:**  [Private React Repo](https://github.com/A-B-G-Inc/rdb-site )



# Day 66: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript Exercises. Improved React Portfolio Website

**Thoughts:** Building the React Portfolio website, I am considering another alternative  - to simply link to it from the Flask website. 

**Link(s) to work:**  [React Portfolio Website](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/react-portfolio.git)


# Day 65: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python Exercises, Javascript Exercises and the React Portfolio Project. Completed Refactored Pretty Price Project.

**Thoughts:** Lots of coding today.  Python projects worked on Inheritance vs Composition.  Javascript, continued with challenges and higher order functions.  Worked on the React Portfolio Project, adding additional features.

**Link(s) to work:**  [Pretty Price Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/advanced-javascript-playground), [React Portfolio Website (Sample)](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/react-portfolio.git), [Python Coding Exercises](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/python3_playground) 
 



# Day 64: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript Exercises.  Refactored Javascript code for Pretty Price Project

**Thoughts:** Javascript continues to improve.  The exercises are crucial. The more comfortable with higher order functions  , array functions and operators I become, the easier and more efficient it is to solve problems. Now refactoring the code - it is much cleaner and more efficient.

# Day 63: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript Exercises.  Started a Mongo-DB Realm based cross-platform Project for an open source project which required a complicated setup. Currently aiming to work on the web version of this platform.

**Thoughts:** Javascript continues to improve.  The Mongo-DB Realm project was fun to set up following the instructions.  However, it was not intuitive that I needed to add the Realm instance to the local codebase, which is its own codebase.  This is probably because I am working for web.  That structure would seem to make more sense with the mobile environment.  It is not running yet, I have to sort out some node package incompatibilities.

# Day 62: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on adding React to the Flask Portfolio Project. Running into a hiccup with webpack building the bundle.js file

**Thoughts:** I have tried out different troubleshooting maneuvers. The React code is not rendering to the page. Based on the error code it seems the problem is with the babel-loader. There may be incompatible versions of Babel or requirements that are old.  Considering downgrading Babel to the older version.

# Day 61: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on adding React to the Flask Portfolio Project to make the portfolio section better, more dynamic and efficient.

**Thoughts:** Super excited to add React to this Flask project.  If this goes smoothly it will be a nice formula to use going forward. Researching this, there are multiple different ways to do it, but none of them seem straightforward or smooth.  I am going with the method on this [blog](http://allynh.com/blog/adding-a-react-frontend-to-your-flask-project/).  React will be added to the Static Folder.  Flask is also serving regular html templates for the static pages as well, plus it will communicate with a database so we shall see if that will fly.

# Day 58: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python Code Exercises, built a small game where you choose your answers to decide your fate. Lesson 43.

**Thoughts:** Getting out of practice with Python from working on Javascript for so long. Now that I am more comfortably immersed in Javascript I don't miss it as much anymore.  Attended conferences on June 16th and June 17th so not as much coding as usual although I learned a few things.

**Link(s) to work:**  [Python Coding Exercises](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/python3_playground)



# Day 57: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a React Portfolio today, explored Routes and Slugs

**Thoughts:** Making nice progress with React.  Really seeing how it makes life easier for building sites.  Starting to second guess using Flask HTML Templates to build the Flask Portfolio site.  It may be still possible to reasonably incorporate React into the project. Reviewing the possibilities.

**Link(s) to work:**  [React Playground](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/react-playground)

# Day 51: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Working on Flask Portfolio App. 

**Thoughts:** Realizing that the Flask template rules are pretty interesting, the behavior is not exactly as expected. I'm considering writing up a blog post about troubleshooting with Flask templates.  The beauty of making  mistakes, frustrating as they may be, is gaining more in depth knowledge of code.

**Link(s) to work:**  [Flask Portfolio Website](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/thisdevlovestech)


# Day 50: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  More React,  state, props conditional rendering hamburger menus.

**Thoughts:** Proud to reach 50 days!

**Link(s) to work:**  [Private React Repo](https://github.com/A-B-G-Inc/rdb-site)


# Day 49: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  More React, rendering, keys, lists, maps, props.

**Thoughts:** Nested dropdown menu kicking my butt.  However I have come up with a plan that I think will work.  Wow almost halfway through 100 days!

**Link(s) to work:**  [Private React Repo](https://github.com/A-B-G-Inc/rdb-site)



# Day 48: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Polishing the private React Website project and adding features. Continuing to learn about displaying info and changing state in React. Reviewing CSS menu features, hamburger menus, sticky menus, fixed menus.

**Thoughts:** So much time spent on CSS. 

**Link(s) to work:**  [Private React Repo](https://github.com/A-B-G-Inc/rdb-site)



# Day 47: June 6, 2020

# Day 46: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with React projects today.  Working on a Portfolio React app and a React Website. I am diving into React state which seems to be like state and context in Android Java development. React components remind me of Fragments in Android Java development.  I think it helps to find corollaries of programming concepts in order to grasp them more quickly.  I know it can only go so far though, so in the end I have to master each concept individually.

**Thoughts:** Pretty satisfied with the progress.

# Day 45: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Deep dive into React now. Learning how to manipulate data and render to the page.  Starting to see where React shines despite the seeming complexity. Working on the React Portfolio App and the private React Website. No Flask portfolio site today.

**Thoughts:**  Happy with the progress and seeing the solutions come together as I'm learning which tools to use, such as map.

# Day 44: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More attention to React now. Exploring the details of the file structures, configurations and dependencies and starting Redux. Also working on building a React website and continuing with the Flask Portfolio Website. Also worked on continuing to build UML diagrams.

**Thoughts:**  Continuing to learn the power of React, improving CSS skills and improving my understanding of project architecture design. This is definitely the fun part of coding.

# Day 43: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to move forward with the Flask Portfolio Project, building out the CSS.  Had to learn how to upload a photo to the DOM - it was not straightforward with Flask.  Continued working on a React App, now figuring out how to make a React Element responsive. These are both private repositories so they will not display on the links.

**Thoughts:**  Glad to be continuing to move forward with understanding React, improving CSS skills and improving my understanding of project architecture design.

# Day 42: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to move forward with the Flask Portfolio Project, building out the CSS. Also started working on a React App. This has been interesting  - learning how to use CSS while keeping track of the DOM tree as needed for React components. These are both private repositories so they will not display on the links.

**Thoughts:**  Glad to be moving forward with improving CSS skills and improving my understanding of project architecture design.  Its interesting to see React projects file structure vs. Flask project file structure, compared to projects which have both frameworks.

# Day 41: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the Flask Portfolio Project, building out the CSS on the home page.  Running into small hiccups, whitespaces, imperfect positioning, etc. but it keeps moving along.

**Thoughts:**  Glad to see the home page taking shape but it is taking a while to get everything perfect.  Maybe better to keep going with a rough build then go back to fix the little imperfections.  Had a nice break with this project, now time to get back to Javascript.

**Link(s) to work:** [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/thisdevlovestech)


# Day 40: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the Flask Portfolio Project, building out the CSS on the home page, very satisfied with the progress. 

**Thoughts:**  CSS is coming along well.  Not a ton of coding today but still making progress.

**Link(s) to work:** [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/thisdevlovestech)


# Day 39: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on the Flask Portfolio Project, building out the CSS on the home page, very satisfied with the progress. Started a small react project in Scrimba. Worked on an Ecommerce Activity Diagram since the Class Diagram is complete.

**Thoughts:**  Learned alot, the second exposure to React after Flask and it makes so much sense.  It now feels almost intuitive.  I have to figure out how to hook up the React front end to the Flask backend then hopefully I can breeze through a powerful web app.

# Day 37: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More Vanilla Javascript practice, Completed the Simple Shopping Cart Project. Continued refactoring the code in the Bottega Diner project, using Map, Filter, Reduce and Spread operators. 

**Thoughts:**  Just two functions away from completing the Diner Project. So close!

# Day 36: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the code in two Javascript projects, using Map, Filter and Spread operators!

**Thoughts:** Learned so much just playing around with the console log and manipulating arrays to get back data in the Diner Project and PrettyPrice Nursery Project. All the weird things about the way Javascript operates became apparent and more manageable.  I think the language is finally starting to sink in, lol.  I have to learn as many functions as possible to be more efficient with my code instead of trying to use the same skills to solve every problem.

# Day 35: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on building a UML Class Diagram for Ecommerce and a simple shopping cart to practice javascript math functions using a scrimba course.

**Thoughts:** Watching and reading other people's javascript code is so helpful!  Certain maneuvers I simply did not realize or remember I could do with Javascript I now notice and can use in my projects.  Reading about using the spread operator and returning objects seems to be exactly what I need to do to solve some of my project challenges.  I will re-tackle my other javascript projects to see if I could refactor the code to be more efficient. No more browser freezing from costly loops, lol. **Map function and spread operator** < ----- I will use these more.

**Link(s) to work:** [Simple Shopping Cart](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/ecommerce)


# Day 34: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Continued work on a sales price/pretty price project in Javascript and built out a UI in HTML & CSS

**Thoughts:** Not too much coding today but a little work on this project. Eager to get back to it tomorrow!

**Link(s) to work:** [Pretty Price Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/advanced-javascript-playground)
 

# Day 33: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on a sales price/pretty price project in Javascript and built out a UI in HTML & CSS

**Thoughts:** Discovered I again used multiple lines of code to solve a problem that only took one line of code.  I think I tend to default to string manipulation which inherently uses more code with all the .toString and parseInt manipulations.  I have to start thinking about the fastest, most efficient formula that will solve the problem in the current data type rather than switching.  The other issue is being aware of all of the numerous tools and formulae which exist.  Also I need to work on styling HTML forms.

**Link(s) to work:** [Pretty Price Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/advanced-javascript-playground)
 


# Day 32: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the Javascript Bottega Diner Project and UML Class Diagrams

**Thoughts:** A light coding day.  Tried Mermaid Js to build the UML Class Diagram but it didn't render the graphs. Some work on the Diner Project. Excited to get closer to completion. Looking forward to more coding.

**Link(s) to work:** [Bottega Diner Menu Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/bottega-diner)
 

# Day 31: May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the Javascript Bottega Diner Project and UML Class Diagrams

**Thoughts:** The Bottega Diner Project is almost finished but its still tricky deciding how to get the returns correctly. It seemed pretty well defined with classes from the beginning but the data dependencies are becoming circular lol.    Created a Twitter Mockup Class Diagram UML which was pretty interesting.  I'm wondering if I used a class diagram for this project if it would have been easier.   I am grateful for the Lodash library it saved me having to add a bunch of extra code.

**Link(s) to work:** [Bottega Diner Menu Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/bottega-diner)
 

# Day 30: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the Javascript Bottega Diner Project and Python Exercises in Classes, Objects and Inheritance.

**Thoughts:** The Bottega Diner Project is almost finished. I'm happy to see progress with getting all of the functions to work properly. It is definitely a challenge but setting up the project with all the todos and working on each function one by one really helped. It also clarified where I have been having issues in Javascript, which is getting data out of arrays and objects. Also worked on Python Classes, Objects and Inheritance using a fun drill method.   Continued learning UML which helped my overall understanding of software project architecture and database organization. Overall, a very productive day.

# Day 29: May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on more Javascript DOM manipulation exercises, Array challenges and the Diner Project.

**Thoughts:** Worked on vanilla javascript exercises with rendering to the DOM.  Javascript data manipulation is continuing to become more clear with these projects and exercises. Started learning UML which seemed like it would be boring and tedious but it actually made a lot of sense and would make building projects easier

# Day 28: May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on more Javascript DOM manipulation exercises and Python exercises - reviewed object oriented programming and classes.

**Thoughts:** Worked on vanilla javascript exercises with rendering to the DOM.  Reviewed Python object oriented programming including classes, objects and inheritance with the wonderful PythonForAll study group. Javascript data manipulation is coming together with these projects. I'm eager to get back to building in Flask, once I complete these Javascript challenges.

# Day 25: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. Worked on practicing lesser known Git functions such as Git diff, Git Stash, Git Rebase and Git Merge and Git Reset

**Thoughts:** Continued working on building a Diner menu webpage and flow using Vanilla Javascript with Math package of Lodash library, html and css. Added extra buttons in CSS and worked out the kinks in the functionality. Worked on the Javascript weighted lottery function about 80% towards solution. Also learned multiple Git features I have never used before  - except maybe out of desperation and Googling and praying that it works and I get my code back, hahaha.  With these new functions plus the pull requests from my fork that I have been doing this week for open source, I feel like I have Git superpowers. ***applause!!!***

# Day 24: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on HTML, CSS and Javascript

**Thoughts:** Continued working on building a Diner menu and flow using Vanilla Javascript with Math package of Lodash library, html and css. Still in progress, not completed yet. This exercise must follow several rules including giving a possible fixed price menu or a total of separate items. There may also be responses from the virtual waitress.

# Day 22: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Explored npm packages, created, published, edited, and updated a custom npm package which was then imported into a basic React App.

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript using npm packages. Published my first [custom npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gingerbee_npm) and published it to the npm library.  It was so fun! This npm package is a javascript import that uses Moment Js library and adds a copyright footer with the current year and company name to any project. 

I accidentally made a commit without saving the completed code.  So I had to learn how to update, edit, update the version number and republish my custom package.  So this was a lesson that mistakes sometimes lead to better discovery and mastery. It was crazy addictive and I think I will enjoy open source and building software tools to make our job more efficient.

# Day 20: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Its Mother's Day so I get a pass, lol.  Just kidding.   Despite attempts, no progress on getting the SQL-Alchemy Sqlite Database working.  A little bit of  work on npm package installation.  Continued working on my Flask Portfolio App. 

**Thoughts:** Did not make substantial forward progress today.  I did my best to debug the sqlite problems on the Flask movie app but I think at this point I will just switch out the database. Either I will learn AWS S3 or PostgreSQL.  That should be fun.  The movie project Flask App is running fine, its just the sqlite database that is a problem.  Speaking of databases,  I started to add the MongoDB database for the portfolio website which is just gravy. I dont think I made any commits since everything is in PostMan or MongoDB land.

# Day 20: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Its Mother's Day so I get a pass, lol.  Just kidding.   Despite attempts, no progress on getting the SQL-Alchemy Sqlite Database working.  A little bit of  work on npm package installation.  Continued working on my Flask Portfolio App. 

**Thoughts:** Did not make substantial forward progress today.  I did my best to debug the sqlite problems on the Flask movie app but I think at this point I will just switch out the database. Either I will learn AWS S3 or PostgreSQL.  That should be fun.  The movie project Flask App is running fine, its just the sqlite database that is a problem.  Speaking of databases,  I started to add the MongoDB database for the portfolio website which is just gravy. I dont think I made any commits since everything is in PostMan or MongoDB land.

# Day 19: May 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on building a Flask API for a movie database site.  Flask with SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow and Cloudinary. Continued working on my Flask Portfolio App. Super Flask day today which is great.

**Thoughts:** Even though I built a Flask API with SQLite database before and it worked perfectly fine, this one built while coding along with a live demo gave me a shitload of trouble for no apparent reason.  The database doesnt want to accept the data for some reason.  I think it was because I missed marshmallow-sqlalchemy in the initial package install.  So when I installed it then it popped up a database that still wouldn't work.  So then I deleted the database  and reinstalled all the modules and it still didnt want to cooperate. Then I created a database and it just sits there non-functional. Postman basically says...its not our problem Operational Error with the drivers of the database, etc.  I have to walk away before I rage launch this computer through the window.  

I also worked on the Flask Portfolio Website which is coming along nicely. Overall I think my understanding of Flask continues to improve the more I work with it and I still think its a fun framework.

# Day 18: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on Javascript, established advanced javascript dev environment, installed packages via npm, imported Javascript modules. Continued working on the Flask Portfolio App. 

**Thoughts:** Github is amazing. Received my first security alert for a dependency vulnerability in my javascript file. It was sent by email moments after I pushed to the repo. Good thing its a development environment running on node js, so there's no threat.  This feature is quite impressive.

# Day 17: May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on Javascript,learned about the Quokka extension and error handling.  Read about Flask project architecture. Continued working on the Flask App. [Explore Flask](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/preface.html)

**Thoughts:** I need to spend more time on Javascript, getting used to manipulating the functions and getting it to solve problems.  It does not come fluidly like it does for Python, html, css even. I am still enjoying working on the Flask app,  I love seeing it come together.

## Day 16: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy day. Worked on Javascript random number challenge, Lodash Javascript Library and Map, Filter and Reduce.  Worked on Python exercises re: Modules, Classes and Objects with PythonFor All study group.  Read about Flask project architecture. Added initial CSS variables and links to the Flask Portfolio Website Project. [Explore Flask](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/preface.html)

**Thoughts:**  I spent a fair amount of time on the projects but not sure I truly made significant progress in each.  I did learn some new concepts and move forward in each discipline so in that perspective Day 16 was a success.  I definitely felt a little disconcerted at times and of course, wonder if I could have accomplished more working in depth in one or two things rather than covering so much ground in one day.

## Day 15: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: It has been Javascript all day today.  Read about Flask project structures which was also great [Explore Flask](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/preface.html)

**Thoughts:**  Worked on solving a Javascript problem - weighted lottery function. No commits because I have not found the solution yet. I know what needs to happen but I keep runnning into challenges with manipulating the different data structures to give the result.  It seems like it should be easy but then the challenges arise.  I did solve this exact same problem in Python with no issues at all.

**Link(s) to work:**  No commits today.

## Day 14: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work on Javascript Promises, Callbacks and Async Await. 

**Thoughts:**  Worked on learning Javascript more Promises and asynchronous Functional programming.  It is finally starting to sink in - fetch API, callbacks, vs promise vs async await. Flask app also got more html template coding. Started learning JQuery but no commits yet.

### Day 13: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added additional html templates and App Routes for the Portfolio Website Flask App!! Worked on Javascript Promises, Group Promises and Callbacks. 

**Thoughts:**  Worked on learning Javascript more Promises and Functional programming.  In addition read entire Javascript Beginners Handbook which was a great review of everything I learned thus far.  The Portfolio Website Flask App continues to move along nicely. I changed the blog page design and I am much happier with it now. I realized that I needed to add more app routes for the details page of the blog posts and projects. 

I wonder if the project is too big and if there will be effects on loading and performance. This was always a consideration with Android Mobile Development - I have no idea how it translates to the web.  Now it is time to get into the nuts and bolts of how the blog posts and projects will be arranged and loaded onto the templates.  This will be the challenging part of the project I think...well besides the CSS of course, lol. Then I have to think about hosting and deployment. Well...one step at a time.

### Day 12: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed App Routes for the Portfolio Website Flask App!! Worked on Javascript Promises. 

**Thoughts:**  ***I am having way too much fun coding this Flask App!!!!***  It is without a doubt the highlight of my coding experience.  Since I have an extra organized build process now, it makes it super easy and enjoyable.  My process:  I created the file structure first. Downloaded all of the python modules.  Coded most of the html templates. Today I built the skeleton of the flask app with all the routes to the templates. Created a project to-do Kanban board [My Project](https://github.com/HajaSChilds/thisdevlovestech/projects/1) so that I know exactly what needs to be done. The best part - I can quickly test each segment to ensure it works. This is much better than last time when I coded so much then took 3 days debugging, smh.  Since the build process is so smooth and organized it gives me time to review the documentation. I hope every project I complete is this awesome.  More Javascript exercises as well - Functional Programming and Promises

### Day 11: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. 

**Thoughts:** Javascript Exercises. More Object Oriented programming. I am motivated to get back into the Flask app.  It will happen.

### Day 10: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. Still coding the Flask app foundation 

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much coding done today as I would have preferred.  I wish I could spend more time coding and less time doing other stuff. Worked on Javascript classes, object oriented programing today.

### Day 9: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python exercises. Started coding the Flask app foundation 

**Thoughts:** Trying to keep the rules solid in my mind, switching back and forth with Python and Javascript.  Theres no doubt I prefer Python. Today I worked on Python Dictionaries and Lists and reviewed Lambda functions and zip function with PythonForAll study group. I'm building the Flask app foundation of the Portfolio Website Flask App. ****Someone please explain why is this so much fun?***  I will end up building everything on Flask at the rate I am going.

### Day 7: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript exercises. CSS on To-Do Flask App. Started planning Portfolio Website Flask App

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript Exercises, including spread, bind function, determining object equivalence.  Also tweaked the CSS for the To-Do Flask App.  Started planning the Portfolio Website Flask App ***super excited about this***

### Day 6: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed FLASK APP YAY!!! Worked on Javascript exercises.

**Thoughts:** Found the bugs, big thanks to Stack Overflow and Flask Documentation !!!(***applause***). I currently have a working Flask App with Mongo DB Database and HTML/CSSS user interface. The bugs were so tiny and insignificant and yet they screwed up the whole project.  The first bug was a space between a bracket and modulus in one of the conditionals of the Flask app on the html template file.  The second was the absence of a period before the namespace in the template file. Today I also worked on Javascript Exercises, including more arrow functions, destructuring, object deconstruction, and spread function.

**Caught Bugs Below**

**Two Errors Preventing Jinja2 Engine From Pulling Data into the templates**

#1:
url_for('.index') – Missing the dot before the name             (Flask Documentation)


#2:
Typo, in the second for-loop – extra space before the %         (Stack Overflow) 
{   % for post in posts %}

The Reason: Since there is space after { before % Jinja will not recognize it as an endfor tag. thus giving you the error.



### Day 5: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript Exercises and debugging Flask App

**Thoughts:** Worked on Javascript Exercises, including arrow functions, destructuring and object deconstruction. Printed out error logs for Flask app, there were 17 errors listed, one that included Jinja2. Started going through each one - googling and checking code.  Hopefully this process works!

### Day 4: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, Mongo DB and Javascript Practice 

**Thoughts:** Haven't figured it out yet, why the data is not being pulled into the HTML templates. Now going through the code with a fine tooth comb.  I should have known that trying to figure out issues at this point would be a nightmare. I needed to test it sooner instead of building so much and trying to figure it out later.  That was never going to work, of course. I will give a few more days then scrap it and start from scratch and debug properly.

### Day 3: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, Mongo DB and more Javascript review

**Thoughts:** Worked on the HTML part of the Flask app.  For some reason the Jinja2 engine is not pulling data into the HTML templates although the Flask app is running. I have to troubleshoot that. On another note, I realize how rare it is for me to use table in my html documents.  I read somewhere that prior to modern css - flexbox and grid - developers would use TABLE to layout and position elements. Yikes!  As much as I have been tortured by flexbox and css-grid I would not have made it typing out all those tr's and td's!!

### Day 2: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML, a small Javascript review, and some Python exercises

**Thoughts:** The HTML part of the Flask app continues to go well. I'm excited to see it all coming together.  I reviewed Python exercises and briefly saw some of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.  I definitely like Python 3 better so far. Just working on Javascript after spending a few weeks on Python I was forgetting all of the semicolons and yet things were still running...

### Day 1: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML and also a small Javascript challenge

**Thoughts:** The HTML part of the flask app went really well. I practiced using the Emmet abbreviations in VS Code, made everything super snappy.  The Javascript challenge was also fun.  I was able to see that it took me six lines of code to solve a simple challenge and the solution only needed one line of code plus a one line error built in.  Well at least I came up with a solution that worked. Student - 0 Instructor - 1  I realize I need to spend time understanding arrow functions in Javascript

### Day 0: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App with MongoDB, HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** It was super fun. Opening the python virtual environment, installing all the python modules, creating the Flask app with the routes for Mongo DB, which I just binge learned the week before (watching every video tutorial imaginable). Plus I spent 4 days pulling my hair out, and my computer literally threatened to report me, while trying to get MongoDB to actually run on the non-admin account on my computer.
